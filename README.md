# Artificial-Neural-Network

We developed Artificial Neural Network from scratch without using any machine learning libraries.

We implemented forward and backward pass algorithm for weight calculation of edges of the neural network.

We trained and tested our neural network on UCI ML repository dataset and got 92% accuracy.

**Technology used:**
- Pandas library for preprocessing of the data
- Python
