# Artificial-Neural-Network
***************ReadMe.txt*****************

The Neural Network is implemented using Python.

We  used command prompt for compilation by using following command.

First, do preprocessing.
For Pre Processing:
 >python PreProcessing.py urlOfDataSet urlOfOutputSet
 
For implementation of  NeuralNetwork:
>python NeuralNet.py ds1 80 500 2 4 2
Where, ds1 = urlOfOutputSet generated after preprocessing
80= the percent of the dataset to be used for training 
200= the maximum number of iterations 
there are 2 hidden layers with (4, 2) neurons.
